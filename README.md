# News-Reading
A simple console application I worked on during college. It allows the user to create new articles, read existing articles as well as adding them to a list of favorites.
The user is also able to filter the articles to show only the ones that interest them. 
The application was written in the C programming language and uses Structures, Pointers, I/O Files, as well as various commands from the "System" library.

The user is able to navigate through the application menu using their keyboard, more specifically the W,S and Enter keys.
The menu is responsive and simple to navigate and read, thanks to the "System" library.
